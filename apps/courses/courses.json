It deals with concepts such as Information, Technology, Knowledge, Modeling, as well as their impact on science and society. The course will also attempt to define and understand what computational thinking can bring to science and society. In particular, we will focus on the National Science Foundation's definition of Computational Thinking as \"a set of bold multidisciplinary activities that, [...] promise radical, paradigm-changing research findings. [...] Applied in challenging science and engineering research and education contexts, computational thinking promises a profound impact on the Nation's ability to generate and apply new knowledge.\" The course is designed to present and discuss the history, methodology and impact of informatics; students are introduced to various approaches to informatics through interaction with faculty working on diverse problems, as well as the appropriate literature. Finally, students are expected to develop a understanding of what constitutes research in the field, via a familiarization with relevant funding opportunities, strategies and methods for publishing scientific research, keeping track of the relevant literature in their domain of interest and developing research methodologies.",

Biological systems tend to be adaptive, reactive, and distributed. Bio-inspired computing is a field devoted to tackling complex problems using computational methods modeled after design principles encountered in nature. This course is strongly grounded on the foundations of complex systems and theoretical biology. It aims at a deep understanding of the distributed architectures of natural complex systems, and how those can be used to produce informatics tools with enhanced robustness, scalability, flexibility and which can interface more effectively with humans. It is a multi-disciplinary field strongly based on biology, complexity, computer science, informatics, cognitive science, robotics, and cybernetics.",

This definition applies to systems from a wide array of scientific disciplines. Indeed, the sciences of complexity are necessarily based on interdisciplinary research. Almost all interesting processes in nature are highly cross linked. In many systems, however, we can distinguish a set of fundamental building blocks, which interact nonlinearly to form compound structures or functions with an identity that requires more explanatory devices than those used to explain the building blocks. This process of emergence of the need for new, complementary, modes of description is known as hierarchical self-organization, and systems that observe this characteristic are defined as complex. Examples of these systems are gene networks that direct developmental processes, immune networks that preserve the identity of organisms, social insect colonies, neural networks in the brain that produce intelligence and consciousness, ecological networks, social networks comprised of transportation, utilities, and telecommunication systems, as well as economies. The field of complex systems studies the general characteristics of all these systems. Its goal is to identify and model the laws and behaviors common to various classes of complex systems.",

Typically, the population parameter is defined as the minimizer of a population risk function and its estimate is defined as the minimizer of the empirical risk. While M-estimates are known to enjoy many desirable properties, goodness of fit alone is not an adequate method for selecting the best among models of different \"complexity.\" On the one hand, \"simpler\" models can be more revealing of the structure in the data. On the other hand, they are often restricted versions of more \"complex\" models and hence will never be preferred based on goodness of fit alone. In this course, we cover model selection techniques with an emphasis on variable selection in generalized linear models. We review classical variable selection methods such as AIC, BIC, and Mallows' Cp and discuss some of the computational issues involved. In addition, we introduce some alternative measures of the complexity of a model and review how they can be used for model selection purposes. Finally, we briefly review some of the issues specific to high-dimensional data sets and how they can be addressed.",
